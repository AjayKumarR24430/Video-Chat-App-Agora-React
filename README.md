# Video Chat Application Using Agora SDK and RTM 

## Overview

The Agora Web SDK makes the task of building a real-time engagement application painless. You don’t have to worry about latency, scale, or compatibility. The SDK uses an event-driven approach to handle users and their videos. The React wrapper gives you methods to create hooks that make accessing the client object and tracks object simple.

### Steps to do before running this application:
* Create an account in Agora.
* Sign up at https://console.agora.io and log in to the dashboard.
* Create a project and copy the App ID so that it can be used in this application.

### Prerequisites
* Node >= 10.16
* npm >= 5.6
* React ≥ 16.8

### Steps to make this Video chat app running:
* Clone the repository. Eg: git clone <your_repository_name>
* If you have npm, type in `npm install` to install the packages and dependencies for this project. (Check if typescript is installed since the project has typescript files)
* If you have yarn installed, type `yarn add` to install the packages and dependencies for this project. (Check if typescript is installed since the project has typescript files)
* After installing the dependencies, type `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the app.
* The react app will run on your localhost - [http://localhost:3000].

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
